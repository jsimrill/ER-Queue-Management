Hello! In this Simulation project I will attempt to identify the best way manage the queue efficiency of the ER in a Hospital.

The Goals are as follows:
  -Identify the bottleneck in Queue
  -Find the optimal management method to fix this bottleneck

To achieve this, I will be utilizing the Simmer Package as well as the Simmer.plot package in order to create and run the simulation,
as well as create plots that accurately display data that can be used to identify the bottleneck.
